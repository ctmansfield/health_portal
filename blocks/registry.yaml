    acceptance:
    - Bands render using ref_low/ref_high when present
    - Legend toggles hide/show series lines & points; persisted
    - 'Export-all CSV includes only visible series with headers: timestamp_utc,metric,value,unit,flag'
    - Works for daily and hourly aggregations
    - No layout overlap with summary pane (respects UI-6 grid)
    - tests/test_ui_labs_critical.py passes
