# UI Summary — Summary Card & UI Index Delivery

Last updated: 2025-09-11

This document summarizes the UI work delivered (component, routes, templates, CSS), how to run and test locally, and follow-up suggestions.

Goals achieved
- Light-weight, accessible Summary Card component that consumes the existing API GET /reports/{id}/summary.
- Two preview routes plus a demo page and a small UI index to review related pages quickly.
- Centralized layout and styles for consistent look & feel across pages.
- Minimal, focused edits to server routing and templates; no DB or migration changes.

Key files added / modified
- Component (partial & client script)
  - app/templates/components/report_summary_card.html — component partial (scoped styles, root container: <div class="hp-report-summary-card" data-report-id="{{ report_id|default('') }}">)
  - app/static/js/report_summary_card.js — client behavior (fetch, timeout, states, a11y)
  - srv/api/static/js/report_summary_card.js — same script copied to server static mount so pages load it out-of-the-box

- Server UI routes (srv/api/dashboard.py)
  - GET /ui/components/report-summary-card?id=<uuid> → component partial (HTML)
  - GET /ui/reports/{id}/summary-card → full-page preview of the component
  - GET /ui/demo/report-summary → small dashboard-like demo page embedding the component
  - GET /ui → UI index page listing major UI routes
  - All UI route responses set headers: `Cache-Control: no-store` and `X-Frame-Options: DENY`.

- Templates & layout
  - New shared layout: srv/api/templates/base.html
  - Header include: srv/api/templates/includes/header.html
  - New demo template: srv/api/templates/demo_report_summary.html
  - UI index template: srv/api/templates/ui_index.html (icons + links)
  - Refactored pages to extend base.html: dashboard.html, events.html, events2.html, genomics.html, genomics_report.html, login.html, logged_out.html

- Styling
  - Centralized stylesheet: srv/api/static/style.css
  - New utility classes (btn, form-control, card--narrow, grid-2, form-inline, etc.) and visual polish (card hover lift, transitions)

- Tests
  - tests/test_ui_report_summary_card.py — verifies the UI shell routes render and reference the client script. Tests pass locally.

Accessibility & privacy
- Dynamic regions use `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"`.
- Retry button is a real <button> and receives keyboard focus after actions.
- Client code avoids logging PHI — only non-PHI id and status codes may be logged when needed.
- UI routes include `Cache-Control: no-store` and `X-Frame-Options: DENY` headers.

How to run locally
1. Activate venv:
   . .venv/bin/activate

2. Start dev server (example binding to 0.0.0.0:8800):
   uvicorn srv.api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8800 --reload

3. Open pages:
   - UI index: http://localhost:8800/ui
   - Summary Card demo: http://localhost:8800/ui/demo/report-summary
   - Summary Card preview: http://localhost:8800/ui/reports/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/summary-card
   - Dashboard: http://localhost:8800/dashboard
   - Events: http://localhost:8800/dashboard/events
   - Genomics: http://localhost:8800/genomics

Testing
- Unit/UI tests (server-side shell rendering):
  pytest -q tests/test_ui_report_summary_card.py

Notes / next steps (suggestions)
- Replace inline SVG icons with a small sprite or icon system if the set grows.
- Consider adding light client-side mocks for demo pages so the Summary Card can demonstrate Success, Empty (404), and Error states without a backend.
- Add a small automated visual test (e.g., Playwright) to exercise the client states and focus/aria behavior.
- Consider moving base template into a shared app-level template package if the app grows.

If you want any of the follow-ups implemented (user menu in header, accessible SVG titles, Playwright visual tests, or a small demo mock endpoint), I can implement them next.
