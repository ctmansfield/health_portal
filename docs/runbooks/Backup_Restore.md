# Runbook â€” Backup & Restore

Policy

How To
- Backup now:

  - Provision target Postgres of compatible major version.
  - Restore weekly base, then apply daily logical backups if needed.
  - Run services/healthdb-pg-0001/scripts/refresh_views.sh.
  - Verify with services/healthdb-pg-0001/scripts/verify_report_baseline.sh.

Verification
- After restore, run: scripts/db/verify_counts.sql and UI smoke tests.

Details
