# PR Closeout — Summary Card + critical-series + caching (Redis) — Final

Date: 2025-09-11

This document summarizes the final state of the PR, including the requested switch to Redis-backed caching, how to enable it locally, test instructions, and a checklist of deliverables.

What I changed (final)
- UI
  - app/templates/components/report_summary_card.html
  - app/static/js/report_summary_card.js
  - srv/api/templates/*: base.html, ui_index, demo, dashboard, events, genomics, login, logged_out, includes/header.html (refactor & styles)
  - srv/api/static/js/report_summary_card.js (copied to server static)
  - Centralized styles: srv/api/static/style.css
- API
  - srv/api/reports.py
    - GET /labs/{person_id}/critical-series
      - supports metrics aliases (hr/spo2), agg=daily (mv_daily_vitals), agg=hourly (resampling analytics.data_events)
      - returns UTC and person-local timestamps (hourly path) and tz metadata
      - ETL-aware caching: reads analytics.etl_state keys (mv_daily_vitals_version and critical_series_ttl)
      - lab metric lookups via analytics.lab_results (glucose, hemoglobin) when present
  - srv/api/dashboard.py: UI routes + demo + index (refactor and timezone-aware timestamping)
- Cache
  - app/hp_etl/cache.py
    - Redis-backed cache (preferred). If REDIS_URL not provided, defaults to redis://localhost:6379/0
    - If Redis is unreachable, falls back to process-local simple_cache
    - get/set/clear APIs used across the app (dashboard, critical-series)
- Tests
  - tests/test_ui_report_summary_card.py (UI shell tests)
  - tests/test_api_critical_series.py (unit tests with monkeypatched DB)
  - tests/integration/test_api_critical_series_integration.py (Docker-based integration test; opt-in via HP_DOCKER_TEST=1)
- CI / tooling
  - pytest.ini — registers integration mark and suppresses deprecation warnings in tests
  - docs/UI_SUMMARY.md (high-level summary)
  - docs/PR_CLOSURE.md (this file)

Switching to Redis (how to enable locally)
1. Start Redis (docker):
   docker run -d --name hp-redis -p 6379:6379 redis:7

2. Ensure redis-py is installed in your venv:
   . .venv/bin/activate
   pip install redis

3. Run tests and app with REDIS_URL (if using default localhost you can skip setting it):
   export REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
   pytest -q
   # or run service
   uvicorn srv.api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8800 --reload

Notes:
- cache.py defaults REDIS_URL to redis://localhost:6379/0 so in most local dev setups starting Redis locally is sufficient.
- If Redis is not available the code gracefully falls back to the in-process cache (no change in semantics).

Final acceptance checklist
- [x] Summary Card component partial + client JS implemented
- [x] UI routes + demo + UI index implemented and accessible
- [x] critical-series API: daily + hourly aggregation implemented
- [x] Time zone handling: person-local tz for hourly returned timestamps included
- [x] ETL-aware caching integrated (cache key includes ETL version; TTL can be overridden)
- [x] Redis caching supported and preferred by default (connectivity test on startup)
- [x] Unit tests passing
- [x] Integration test (Docker) available and passing when enabled

Followups / Recommendations
- Production: run Redis as a managed service and set REDIS_URL in the environment for app processes.
- If you want cache writes to be more defensively serialized (avoid JSON overhead), we can use a binary serialization strategy (msgpack) for Redis.
- Enhance lab-table integration: I used a guessed schema for analytics.lab_results; if your lab schema differs I can adapt the SQL mappings.
- Add more metrics and improve mapping to code systems (LOINC) and units.
- Consider adding rate-limits or pagination for very long time ranges, or server-side streaming for very large series.
